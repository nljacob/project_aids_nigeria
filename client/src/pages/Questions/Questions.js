          <br />
          <p>
            AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
                <br /> <br />
            An HIV-positive person receives an AIDS diagnosis after developing one of the CDC-defined AIDS indicator illnesses. An HIV-positive person can also receive an AIDS diagnosis on the basis of certain blood tests (CD4 counts) and may not have experienced any serious illnesses. A positive HIV test does not mean that a person has AIDS. A diagnosis of AIDS is made by a physician according to the CDC AIDS Case Definition.
                <br /> <br />
            Over time, infection with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) can weaken the immune system to the point that the system has difficulty fighting off certain infections. These types of infections are known as opportunistic infections. Many of the infections that cause problems or that can be life-threatening for people with AIDS are usually controlled by a healthy immune system. The immune system of a person with AIDS has weakened to the point that medical intervention may be necessary to prevent or treat serious illness.

          <p>
            HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV means:
            <br />  <br />
            Human: because this virus can only infect human beings. Immuno-deficiency: because the effect of the virus is to create a deficiency, a failure to work properly, within the body’s immune system. Virus: because this organism is a virus, which means one of its characteristics is that it is incapable of reproducing by itself. It reproduces by taking over the machinery of the human cell.
            <br />  <br />
            While AIDS means:
            <br />  <br />
            Acquired: because it’s a condition one must acquire or get infected with; not something transmitted through the genes. Immune: because it affects the body’s immune system, the part of the body which usually works to fight off germs such as bacteria and viruses. Deficiency: because it makes the immune system deficient (makes it not work properly). Syndrome: because someone with AIDS may experience a wide range of different diseases and opportunistic infections.

          <p>
            The only way to determine whether you are infected is to be tested for HIV infection. You can’t rely on symptoms to know whether or not you are infected with HIV. Many people who are infected with HIV don’t have any symptoms at all for many years.
            <br />  <br />
            Similarly, you can’t rely on symptoms to establish that a person has AIDS. The symptoms associated with AIDS are similar to the symptoms of many other diseases. AIDS is a diagnosis made by a doctor based on specific criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

          <br />
          <p>
            There are no common symptoms for individuals diagnosed with AIDS. When immune system damage is more severe, people may experience opportunistic infections (called opportunistic because they are caused by organisms which cannot induce disease in people with normal immune systems, but take the “opportunity” to flourish in people with HIV). Most of these more severe infections, diseases and symptoms fall under the Centers for Disease Control’s definition of full-blown “AIDS.” The median time to receive an AIDS diagnosis among those infected with HIV is 7-10 years.

          <br />
          <p>
            HIV can be transmitted from an infected person to another through:
          <br /><br />
            Blood (including menstrual blood)
            Semen
            Vaginal secretions
            Breast milk
            Blood contains the highest concentration of the virus, followed by semen, followed by vaginal fluids, followed by breast milk.
          <br /><br />
            Activities That Allow HIV Transmission:
          <br /><br />
            Unprotected sexual contact
            Direct blood contact, including injection drug needles, blood transfusions, accidents in health care settings or certain blood products
            Mother to baby (before or during birth, or through breast milk)

            If you test positive, the sooner you take steps to protect your health, the better. Early medical treatment, a healthy lifestyle and a positive attitude can help you stay well. Prompt medical care may delay the onset of AIDS and prevent some life-threatening conditions. It is important to know that a positive HIV test should always be confirmed, to be sure that it is a true positive. If your test result is positive, there are a number of important steps you can take immediately to protect your health:
          <br /> <br />
            See a doctor, even if you don’t feel sick. Try to find a doctor who has experience treating HIV. There are now many new drugs to treat HIV infection. There are important tests, immunizations and drug treatments that can help you maintain good health. It is never too early to start thinking about treatment possibilities.
          <br /> <br />
            Have a tuberculosis (TB) test done. You may be infected with TB and not know it. Undetected TB can cause serious illness. TB can be treated successfully if detected early.
            Recreational drugs, alcoholic beverages and smoking can weaken your immune system. There are programs available to help you stop. Consider joining a support group for people with HIV infection or finding out about other resources available in your area, such as HIV/AIDS-knowledgeable counselors for one on one therapy. There are also many newsletters available for people living with HIV and AIDS.
          <br /> <br />
            There is much you can do to stay healthy. Learning as much as you can is a step in the right direction. Local and/or national resources may be available. Many HIV/AIDS organizations provide services free or on a sliding scale, based on ability to pay.
          <br /> <br />
            Call the CDC National AIDS Hotline for more information and referrals at 1-800-342-2437 (English), 1-800-344-7432, (Spanish), or 1-800-243-7889 (TTY).

          <br />
          <p>
            The short answer is yes. There are things that you can do to stay healthy. Once you find a doctor or clinic, your main objective is to get an evaluation of your general health and immune function.
          <br />  <br />
            Many doctors do the following:
          <br />  <br />
            Administer lab tests to evaluate your immune system. Determine if you have other diseases that might become problematic in the future, including syphilis, TB, hepatitis-B, and toxoplasmosis.
          <br />  <br />
            If you are already infected with one or more of these other illnesses, there may be treatments or prophylaxis available to prevent it from becoming more serious or recurring in the future. If you’re not already infected, doctors may be able to prevent future infection by:
          <br />  <br />
            Administering vaccines. Many HIV positive people get a hepatitis-B vaccine and bacterial pneumonia vaccines, since contracting these diseases could be dangerous for immune suppressed people. Prescribing antiviral treatments and protease inhibitors when tests show immune system impairment.
          <br />  <br />
            Scheduling regular checkups. Checkups may be scheduled every three to six months. Some people need more frequent check-ups, particularly when they are starting new antiviral drugs.
